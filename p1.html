A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages.<br>
The programming language is basically a method that makes it easy for the programmer to write his program in the form of instructions and commands that the computer understands in order to carry out the required work. It is known that the computer converts the scripted language into a series of 0 and 1, on the basis of which it begins its work. These principles and rules are generally:<br>
•	Information and storage<br>
•	Orders and organizing their conduct<br>
•	Special design<br>
The programming process uses special languages called programming languages, which contain vocabulary to guide the system for carrying out specific tasks, in addition to specific rules. A number of special words are in every programming language,some of them (JAVA, Java script, C#, SQL,PHP, and C++)<br>
